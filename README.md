#  Team 60: SpaceTraders Brogrammers
This is our group's CS 2340 Objects and Design project. It's a SpaceTraders game in which you create your own character with various skill point customizations, and you can travel around to different regions in the universe, encountering traders, police, and bandits as you go. There are different marketplaces in each region which sells various objects, depending on the tech level of a particular region. 
There is a 'universe' in a random region's marketplace, and if you purchase it, you **win the game**!
If you run out of health on your ship, you **lose the game**, and are given the chance to restart a new game with a new character.
# Starting the Game
In order to start the game, install python flask with the following command:

    pip install flask
You're ready to begin the web app! From the project's root directory, simply type
